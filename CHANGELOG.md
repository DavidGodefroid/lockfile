# Changelog

## v0.2.0

The console, the agent side and the human commands, on lockkit v0.1.0.

- `lockfile console --profile P`: lockkit's console with lockfile's backend: plans validated
  from the request and the local install only, approval screens without file data, one run per
  approved plan (same peer, 10 minutes, unchanged policy), results released on the answer
  quantum, audit of every fetch and plugin outcome.
- Agent commands `status`, `sources`, `plugins`, `plan [--run]`, `run`, `answers`, `release`
  and the `lockfile mcp` server (seven tools); nothing outside the closed list of the security
  model reaches the agent, checked end to end over the socket.
- `lockfile init` wires Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Gemini CLI.
- Human commands: `install` (separated setup, Linux), `profile add`, `plugin
  install|update|remove|list|verify`, `marketplace add|remove|list`, `doctor [--fix]`, `audit`,
  `forget`, `update`.
- Plugin and release signatures checked with lockkit's `update` (cosign keyless).
- Releases: GoReleaser, signed `checksums.txt`, `scripts/install.sh` (requires cosign).

Not in this release: the `setup` wizard, a macOS console, public-key trust roots for
unofficial marketplaces, the website.
